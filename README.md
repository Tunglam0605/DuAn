⚡ PROJECT VAULT
Private Monorepo • 2 builders • Unlimited projects

🔒 Repo: Private	📦 Mode: Monorepo	🚀 Build: Iterate | Ship

“Keep it clean. Keep it fast. Keep it shipping.” 😎

🌈 What is this?
A private vault for many small projects inside one repository. No noise. No public flex. Just build + store + revisit anytime.
•	✅ One repo
•	✅ Many projects (folders)
•	✅ Two people working smoothly
•	✅ Easy to clone & continue on any machine
🧭 Quick Navigation
•	📦 Embedded/ — MCU firmware, drivers, protocols
•	🤖 Robotics/ — motion, kinematics, control
•	🧭 ROS2/ — navigation, bringup, configs
•	👁️ Vision/ — OpenCV, YOLO, calibration
•	🌐 IoT/ — MQTT, apps, services
•	📚 Docs/ — notes, diagrams, reports
•	🛠️ Tools/ — scripts, utilities, helpers
🗂️ Suggested Structure

🧩 Add a new project (fast)
1.	1) Pick a category folder (or create one)
2.	2) Create a new folder for the project
3.	3) Drop a mini README inside that folder (required)
Example
Vision/CV_ObjectDetect_YOLOv8/
  ├─ README.md
  ├─ src/
  └─ docs/

⚡ Quickstart
git clone <this-repo>
cd PROJECT_VAULT

🧼 Minimal Team Rules
So the repo stays clean even when it grows:
•	✅ Each project folder should have: README.md, src/ (or firmware/), and docs/ (optional).
•	🚫 Avoid committing build output (build/, dist/, .pio/), caches (__pycache__/), and huge datasets/videos.
•	🔁 Keep each project self-contained: anyone can open the folder and understand how to run it.

Two people — One vault — Infinite projects
